*Introduction*

This is the general rough view:

go more in depth later. And drawings too. Also I think we should watcha a couple vids before doing github
or else there might be problems with merging. I think it's always better to code and not use android
studio's gui to amke stuff if i recall.

Decription:
Pretty much the people already have cards and we just need to manage the chips for them. This application is for people without chips but have cards. 

Money:
We can make this a paid app by locking some menu options out. such as only allow four players unless they
pay for the application. or They can't play tournament game without buying the app.
